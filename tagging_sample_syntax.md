# Sample tags and syntax
{: #sample-and-syntax}

You can use tags to help you organize and manage your resources. Consider writing tags as `key:value` pairs to help organize your development environments, projects, compliance, and optimization throughout your organization.

| Type | Examples | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Environment | `env:dev`, `env:test`, `env:stage`, `env:prod` | Tag resources to identify development environment.|
| Project | `project:lw-wizard`, `app:poc-app` | Tag resources to identify a project. |
| Compliance | `dataresidency:germany`, `compliance:hippa`, `compliance:pii` | Tag resources to define compliance requirements |
| Optimization | `schedule:24x7`, `maxruntime:12days` | Tag resources to help you automate optimization. |
